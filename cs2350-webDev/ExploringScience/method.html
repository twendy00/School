      <p>The scientific method is a process of discovering things about our
        world. Scientists use this process to learn new things. <a

          title="Go to How Stuff Works to learn about the Scientific Method works">
          Howstuffworks</a> presents a 12 page article explaining the scientific
        method.</p>
      <p>When you review articles on the scientific method you discover that the
        steps are not always the same. As you look closer they really mean about
        the same thing and are just presented using different words. Here is a
        list of the steps of the scientific method that reflects the general
        process.</p>
      <h2>Steps of the Scientific Method</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Observation/Question</li>
        <li>Hypothesis</li>
        <li>Prediction</li>
        <li>Testing through experimentation</li>
        <li>Draw a conclusion</li>
        <li>Refine and Repeat</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Testing the Hypothesis</h2>
      <p>One of the important details is that the hypothesis must something that
        can be tested. Without the ability to test the hypothesis there is no
        way to draw a firm conclusion. This requirement makes it so some ideas
        never become theories.</p>
      <p>The process can be meaningful when the hypothesis is proven to be wrong
        as well as when it is proven to be right. In either case something can
        be learned.</p>
