      <h1>The WISE Telescope</h1>
      <h2>Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer</h2>
      <img src="resources/wise.jpg" class="telescope" alt="The WISE telescope"
        width="226" height="170">
      <p class="telescope_paragraph">The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
        (WISE) was commissioned to create infrared images of the sky. The WISE
        telescope gathered information of light waves in the 2.6 to 26 microns
        range, light waves that we cannot see with our eyes. This information is
        then recolored back into the visible light spectrum so we can see it
        with our eyes. It took multiple images of the same position in the sky
        to increase the accuracy of the results.</p>
      <p>This telescope was designed and built in Logan, Utah at the <a
          href="http://www.sdl.usu.edu/programs/wise"> Space Dynamics
          Laboratory</a>. To see a video that does a great job of talking about
        the Wise telescope see the <a

      <h2>Seeing Heat</h2>

        alt="Image that shows the different temperatures of drinking containers">
      <p>We humans only see visible light. This is a very small portion of all
        the light that exists. The infrared spectrum includes radiation that has
        longer wave lengths than visible light and shorter wave lengths than
        microwave. Infrared radiation is produced by anything that has a
        temperature above absolute zero. The warmer an object the more infrared
        radiation is emitted. There are ways to capture this light and produce
        visible images. These images allow us to see images of things that we
        cannot see with our eyes. Because the variations are based on
        temperature, it is a way to see in heat.</p>
      <img src="resources/heat2.png" class="heat_cup" width="258" height="194"
        alt="Image that shows the different temperatures of tea cup">
      <p class="cup_paragraph">The WISE telescope was designed to take infrared
        images of space. Visible light is one of the few wavelengths that can
        penetrate our atmosphere. Most other forms of radiation are blocked by
        the atmosphere. Because the atmosphere blocks the infrared waves, the
        images must be taken from outside the atmosphere. </p>
      <h2>Orbiting Cold</h2>
      <img src="resources/orbit.jpg" class="orbit"
        alt="The WISE telescope in orbit" width="500" height="363">
      <p class="orbit_paragraph">The WISE telescope was successfully launched on
        December 14, 2009. It began its scheduled imaging on January 14, 2010.
        There are four focal plane arrays that capture the energy and convert it
        to electrical signals that are used to create the images. These sensors
        are worth two million dollars each. The sensors must be kept very cold,
        between 5-7 degrees Kelvin. This is so they do not see their own heat.
        To do this, the telescope is kept in solid hydrogen. It was launched
        with enough hydrogen to keep it cold for 9 months.</p>
      <h2>Seeing the Universe in Spectacular Detail</h2>
      <img src="resources/galaxies.jpg" class="galaxy"
        alt="WISE image of the hidden galaxy" width="400" height="400">
      <p class="galaxy_paragraph">The WISE telescope was able to gather
        information that was used to produce very detailed pictures of the
        universe. These images are far better than any images previously
        produced. After such a spectacularly successful mission the WISE
        spacecraft transmitter was turned off on February 17, 2011. It remains
        in orbit and is currently in hibernation without ground contact awaiting
        possible future use.</p>
      <img src="resources/black_holes.jpg" class="holes"
        alt="Image of black holes taken by the WISE telescope" width="673"
        height="429">
      <p>Millions of black holes have been discovered. The images from the WISE
        telescope reveal dust-obscured objects that are black hole candidates.
        They also show extreme dust-obscured galaxies call hot DOGs.</p>
      <p>Scientists are learning how black holes and galaxies can evolve
        together. One example is a black hole in the center of our very own
        Milky Way galaxy in a bright and compact astronomical radio source
        called Sagittarius A*. </p>
