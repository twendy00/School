      <h2>CSS Box Model</h2>
      <h3>The CSS Box Model Explained</h3>
      <p>All HTML elements can essentially be viewed as boxes, which is the box
        model. The box model allows us to size, space, position, and add any
        properties (ex. color, background, etc.) to HTML elements. These boxes
        consist of a margin, border, padding, and content.</p>
      <img src="resources/boxmodel_opt.png" alt="Image of box model" width="300"
        height="200">
      <ul>
        <li>Margin: the space around the border. It can create distance between
          elements on the page. </li>
        <li>Border: the area or line that exists between the padding and margin.
        </li>
        <li>Padding: the space between the content and border.</li>
        <li>Content: the content of the element such as text, an image, video,
          etc. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The Padding Property</h3>
      <div class="padding1">
        <p>As stated above, the padding determines how much space is between the
          content and the border. The top, right, bottom and left spaces can be
          determined individually. In this box, the padding has been set to 30px
          all around, so the space around the content is equidistant on all
          sides. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="padding2">
        <p>The padding in this box has been set to 50px on the top and bottom
          and 125px on the left and right. You should be able to see how the top
          and bottom spaces between the content and border are more narrow than
          the left and right spaces.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="padding3">
        <p>In this box, the padding on each side has been set to a different
          size. The top is at 150px, the right is at 120px, the bottom is at
          75px and the left is at 50px.You should be able to see how the space
          between the content and border are all different sizes.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>The Margin Property</h3>
      <div class="margin1">
        <p>The margin property determines how much space exists beyond the
          border surrounding the box element. By adjusting the margin-top,
          margin-left, margin-bottom and margin-left properties, more space can
          be used to create space between any other box elements. In this
          example, the margin is set to default.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="margin2">
        <p>This box has the margins set to 50px on the left side. You should be
          able to see that it's been shifted out from the right by 50px.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="margin3">
        <p>This box has the margins set to 160px on the left side. You should be
          able to see that it's been shifted out from the right by 160px.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Changing Style on Hover</h2>
      <p>Hovering over an element means moving your mouse above it. However, it
        cannot be utitlized by the user if they do not have a device for
        hovering (eg. finger tapping on mobile and tablets).</p>
      <p>Although hovering must be used wisely to account for all types of
        devices and usability, applying a hover style can indicate to users of a
        certain action or to help an element stand out.</p>
      <div class="hover1">
        <p>Example 1: No hover</p>
      </div>
      <div class="hover2">
        <p>Example 2: Hover style changes the background color from blue to
          orange over a period of 4 seconds.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="hover3">
        <p>Example 3: Hover style expands the width and height to 500px each
          over a period of 2 seconds.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Color Contrast</h2>
      <p>Color contrast is important to consider to ensure web accessibility and
        that your user can actually see your content easily. Below is a table
        with a few examples of color contrasts. When contrasting colors, it is
        best to aim for a AA or AAA rating. More information about color
        contrast can be found <a

      <h2>Positions</h2>
      <h3>Relative Position</h3>
      <p>Relative positioning sets the position relative to itself. Changing the
        top, right, bottom and left will move the image from where it would
        naturally appear. The bee picture below has been set to a relative
        position, and it has been moved 10px from the left.</p>
      <h3>Absolute Position</h3>
      <p>Elements with an absolute position will stray outside of the document
        flow and anchor itself to its first positioned ancestor. If there are no
        positioned ancestors, then the element will anchor itself to the initial
        document html. Changing the top, right, bottom and left properties will
        cause the element to move relative to its parent element. For example,
        the iceberg picture below is set to absolute and at 200px from the
        right. It also has a z-index, which determines overlapping images. Since
        the z-index is positive at 2, it will be placed in the forefront above
        the fireworks image.</p>
      <h3>Fixed Position</h3>
      <p>Last but not least, the fireworks image to the right has a fixed
        position. A fixed position causes the element to stay anchored with the
        HTML document as a whole. Scrolling will not impact it, and it will
        remain on the page when scrolling. Moving the image through the top,
        right, bottom and left properties will cause it to move relative to the
        HTML document. In the fireworks example, the image is set to 500px from
        the bottom and 0px from the right. The z-index has been set to -2 so it
        will go behind any other elements that overlap it.</p>

      <h2>Shadows</h2>
      <div>
        <p class='hshadow1'>Horizontal Property</p>
        <p class='hshadow2'>Horizontal Property</p>
        <p>The h-shadow is the first element of the text-shadow property. It
          specifies how horizontally far away the shadow should be from the
          text. The first h-shadow text above is set at 3px while the second
          v-shadow text is set to 10px. When using the text-shadow property,
          this is a required field.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class='vshadow1'>Vertical Property</p>
        <p class='vshadow2'>Vertical Property</p>
        <p>The v-shadow is the second element of the text-shadow property. It
          specifies how vertically far away the shadow should be from the text.
          The first v-shadow text below is set at 3px while the second v-shadow
          text is set to 10px. When using the text-shadow property, this is a
          required field.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class='blur1'>Blur Property</p>
        <p class='blur2'>Blur Property</p>
        <p>The blur-radius is the third element of the text-shadow property.
          Setting the blur value higher will cause the shadow to become wider
          and lighter. The first blur shadow is set at 3px, but the second blur
          value is set to 10px. </p>
