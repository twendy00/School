      <h2>Learning Strategies</h2>
      <p>John Dunlosky from Kent State University and several collaborators from
        a variety of universities published an article in January of 2013. For
        this research they looked at 10 learning techniques and rated each one
        on how effective it was.</p>
      <p>Many of the learning strategies that students commonly use were found
        to be ineffective. By developing an understanding of more effective
        learning techniques, a person can become a more effective learner. </p>

      <h2>The Top Strategies</h2>
      <p>Following are the five learning techniques that were found to have high
        or moderate utility. It is interesting to note that one of the reasons
        that some of these techniques received a moderate utility rating was
        because there was less research available on these techniques. As
        additional research is developed, these techniques may be shown to have
        high utility.</p>

      <h3>Practice Testing</h3>
      <p>Practice testing can consist of either self-testing or taking formal
        practice tests. Simply stopping during study to think of questions about
        the material and answering those questions to yourself is an effective
        tool for learning.</p>

      <h3>Distributed Practice</h3>
      <p>The idea behind distributed practice is to break up your practice
        sessions into small periods over a longer period of time. Other words
        used for this strategy are spaced repetition or spaced practice.</p>

      <h3>Interleaved Practice</h3>
      <p>Interleaving practice is when you mix a variety of topics in your study
        sessions. Instead of studying a single topic to completion before moving
        to the next topic you go from one topic to another and study them
        interchangeably.</p>

      <h3>Elaborative Interrogation</h3>
      <p>This technique involves turning the fact you are learning into a why
        question and then coming up with the answer. Asking why is something you
        were very good at as a small child. It is still an effective learning
        technique as an adult but this time you get to use the resources
        available to figure out the answer.</p>

      <h3>Self-Explanation</h3>
      <p>This technique involves generating your own explanation about what you
        are learning. Trying to understand new material well enough to explain
        it helps you learn it more effectively. It also helps to connect
        previous knowledge with what you are currently learning.</p>
