        <h2>Distractions</h2>
        <p>Distractions come in many sizes and shapes. To be effective in our
          work we need to recognize and learn how to handle whatever
          distractions come our way. Consider the following collection of
          distractions, their descriptions, and ideas for managing them.
          Provided by the CS 2350 students.</p>

        <h2>Distraction: Video Games</h2>
        <p>Video games are a new source of entertainment in the world, but they
          also act as the bane to many's existence. I find myself often in the
          middle of a match of something like Rainbow Six Seige and remember
          that I have five papers due in a couple of hours. I then remember that
          I never forgot that - I just got distracted by something more fun than
          writing the papers. Video games, needless to say, are a big source of
          frustration when trying to get work done in my life.</p>
        <p>The way I combat my need to be doing anything other than finishing my
          schoolwork is really simple - instead of using it as a distraction
          from school, I use it as a reward for getting school done. This allows
          me to enjoy my leisure time guilt free so I can relax and work harder.

        <h2>Distraction: Social Media</h2>
        <p>Something that used to constantly distract me was social media. If I
          had even just a few minutes of time to burn (or even if I didn’t), I
          was constantly checking Facebook or Reddit. I’d scroll through new
          stories, viral gifs, and funny memes as soon as I woke up in the
          morning, during slow times at work, and to avoid eye contact with
          strangers. I was wasting a significant amount of my severely limited
          time on these sites, yet found I had no time to do things I actually
          wanted to, like read books or play music. I also realized that my
          homework was taking me much longer to complete because I was
          constantly interrupted by checking out the next meme or status update.
        </p>
        <p>One big problem with this was that I was not enjoying the time I was
          wasting on social media. It was not just detrimental to my schoolwork,
          but to my happiness as well. I was simply unable to regulate my time
          on these addictive sites, so I decided to quit altogether. Some people
          might be able to moderate their time on social media, and some people
          might find it a positive thing in their lives; but for me, quitting
          had many more benefits than disadvantages. I have been a more
          effective worker and a better listener. I’ve started reading books for
          fun again, and I have more time and focus to spend on homework. I’m
          glad I finally made the change.</p>

        <h2>Distraction: Smart Phone Distraction</h2>
        <p>When I think about things that distract me, I cannot help but think
          about technology. Technology is definately a good thing but i've
          noticed that it is the number one distraction in my life. Checking my
          phone every few minutes for a text or snapchat has now become a habit
          that is hard to control.</p>
        <p>I will admit that I am addicted to my phone but i've tried a few
          things that led me away from the phone in order to get work done. One
          thing I did was to put it on airplane mode for an entire day and keep
          it in a place that it will not be accessed easily. After this I made
          it a goal to get all of my planned work done for the day and at the
          end of the day I could use it. By doing this, I used my phone as a
          reward system for completing work and being productive</p>

        <h2>Distraction: Reading!</h2>
        <p>I love to read. I always have a book that I am in the middle of. I
          tend to read a book a week. Mostly fantasy and horror books. This can
          be distracting for me because I get really wrapped up in which ever
          book I happen to be reading at that time. So I can be working on
          something and instead of focusing on the task at hand I will be
          thinking about what ever part of the book that I am on currently. I
          will be trying to guess what is going to happen or what I would do in
          that situation. Also thinking about when I can get back to the book.
          The main problem is when I get to into a book and barley put it down.
        </p>
        <p>Honestly speaking I have trouble with this type of distraction. I
          enjoy reading so its hard to not think about it. To help with this I
          try to only read when I am on the bus or waiting room. I tend to push
          it to the point of only reading at certain times and days. So I would
          say the best way to manage this kind of distraction is to do it at
          appropriate times and try to put it out of your head when you can.</p>

          width="172" height="172">
        <h2>Distraction: Video Games</h2>
        <p>I love video games. Ever since I was little I have had a passion for
          video games and how they worked. I was introduced to the Playstation 1
          when I was about 4 years old and after playing games like Croc, Spyro,
          Tekken, and mature games that I probably wasn't allowed to play
          *cough* (Duke Nukem).</p>
        <p>Now that I am learning how computers work and how software is
          written, I often find that my child hood desire to play video games
          often gets in the way. Since I am a full time student at Weber State
          University and working part time as an insurance agent, the last thing
          I have is spare time. Yet, I tend to find ways to talk myself into
          thinking that I'll have time to play "just one quick game". Although
          there is nothing wrong with having hobbies and spending some time for
          recreation, I have often found myself constantly distracted. This page
          offers some advice to provide insight on how to overcome your
          distraction(s).</p>
        <p>I have found that continually asking myself, "Is what I am doing
          right now worth my time?" has really helped me stay on track of what
          is really important. If I find it hard to stay focused while reading
          or doing homework, the best thing to do is to get up, stretch, remind
          myself why I am doing the task that needs to be completed, and start
          again.</p>

          height="172">
        <h2>Distraction: Music and Work </h2>
        <p> I find myself looking for many excuses to distract myself from the
          actual work that I should be doing, whether it is school or my job.
          One of those distractions tends to be listening to music. Don't get me
          wrong, I enjoy how music can motivate and inspire, but for me it can
          also be a distraction. I find myself bouncing around different
          stations on Spotify or Apple music, as well as my own 250gb library of
          music. If I stop to think about why I haven't setup a playlist for
          certain songs, I will get even more distracted. Sometimes, I will
          spend an hour just jumping from artist to artist, reminiscing about
          where I first heard a song or how much it affects my mood at that
          moment.</p>
        <p> Getting myself to push shuffle or choose a single album to listen to
          is a difficult task at times. To overcome the urge to radio surf, I
          must shuffle through a genre, or pause all together and not put my
          headphones on. With the right kind of music, though, I can feed off
          the energy and push through a long document or group of tasks that
          often get pushed aside. It is quite refreshing to look at the amount
          of work that I can get done with the right combination of songs but
          this only happens with due diligence.</p>
