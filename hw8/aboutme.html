      <p>Hi, I'm Wendy. I started learning to cook after college when I was
        living on my own and realized I couldn't subsist purely off of mac and
        cheese and PB&Js. As I started exploring beyond the pasta, bread and
        condiments aisles at the grocery store though, I quickly realized I had
        no idea what to buy and what was really considered healthy. After
        hemorrhaging more than enough money on unneccesary ingredients and
        snacks, I learned to meal plan in advance and arm myself with a grocery
        list before venturing to the store, and through enough time and
        experience, I've learned to be an expert meal planner. </p>
      <p>However, as I learned to bring my lunches to work from my meal
        planning, I continually watched my colleagues spend money to purchase an
        unhealthy lunch every day. Why didn't they pack a lunch? Time and
        effort! My colleagues had a busy career and a family to raise, which
        made it hard to find the time to make healthy meals. Or, like I
        originally was, they just didn't know how. </p>
      <p>As somebody who loves to create more time with friends and family by
        optimizing/automating work and chores, I decided to share the meal plans
        that I'm making every week to help others.</p>
