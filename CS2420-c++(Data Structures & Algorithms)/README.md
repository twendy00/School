Course
Description:
General principles of common data structures and design of efficient algorithms. Topics include: arrays, linkedlists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, tables, storage and retrieval structures, searching, sorting, hashing, and
algorithmic analysis. Emphasis will be on abstraction, efficiency, re-usable code, and object-oriented
implementation. Prerequisites: CS SI1410 and co/pre-req of MATH QL1050 or 1080.
Course
Objectives:
By the end of the course, students will understand the following concepts:
* To reinforce good scheduling and working habits
* To learn adaptable skills in a software development workplace environment
* Object-oriented program design
* Algorithm development techniques
* The conceptual idea behind as well as the implementation of the data structures including static and dynamic
arrays, vectors, linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary trees
* Comparing and contrasting efficiency both in time and space for these data structures
* Common search and sort algorithms
