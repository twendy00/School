# Course Description
An introduction to the C++ language. Topics will include data types, control structures, functions, pointers, arrays, I/O streams, classes, objects, encapsulation, overloading, inheritance and the use of these concepts in problem-solving.

# Learning Objectives
At the conclusion of this class, the students will be able to:
* Successfully compile, link, and run single-file and multi-file C++ programs;
* Identify key differences and similarities between object-oriented programming and
structured programming;
* Design and implement working object-oriented solutions to given problems;
* Correctly create object-oriented solutions that overload functions and operators and take
advantage of polymorphism;
* Create robust programs that expect and recover from runtime errors and exceptions;
* Appropriately use UML class diagrams in the design of their own programs; and
* Efficiently use C++â€™s I/O streams to read from and write to files.
