This is why you see C++ developers use two kinds of files: header files (**.h** or **.hpp**) and implementation files (**.cpp**). The class definition should only contain the data members of the class and the prototypes of its member functions. Such definition should be in a **header file** (**.h** or **.hpp**). This header file is included using the `#include \"header_file_name.h\"` directive at the top of the implementation file (**.cpp**), which also contains the definitions of the class member functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Classes in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) do not exist in isolation; they relate to one another. OOP focus on four main kinds of class relationships.\n",
    "* **Association** which is the most generic relationship between two classes A and B. For example, a student (class A) is taught by multiple instructors (class B).\n",
    "* **Aggregation** which captures the relationship between a child class and a parent class such that the child class can still exist outside or without the parent class. For example, a quiz (parent class) has many questions (child class). While the quiz is a container for questions, the questions can still exist and be useful outside the quiz.\n",
    "* **Composition** which captures the whole-part relationship such that the part cannot exist without the whole. For example, a room (the part) cannot exist without the house (the whole). Another example is a choice in a multiple-choice question. This choice depends on the question and cannot exist outside of it.\n",
    "* **Generalization**  where a class is said to be a special case of another, or look like another. Here we use the terms of **superclass** and **subclass** (or **base** and **derived**) with the subclass (or derived) being a special case of the superclass (or base). For example, a bank account can the thought of as a superclass for the more specialized checking and savings accounts. This relationship is the basis for **inheritance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance** is the cornerstone of OOP. It allows a class `A` to inherit the **public** and **protected** data and function members of another class `B`. **Private members and constructors cannot be inherited.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, having the calss:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "class A {\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define a new class `B` that inherits the **public** and **protected** members of class `A` like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "class B : public A {\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `:` after the class name is similar to the `extends` keyword in Java. The `public` before the `A` indicates the kind of inheritance: in this case, **public inheritance**, which is the kind of inheritance that we should always use unless we have a valid reason not to. In this kind of inheritance, all the public members of the base class (`A`) will become public members in the derived `B` class. Similarly, all the protected members of the base `A` class will be made protected members of the derived `B` class. \n",
    "\n",
